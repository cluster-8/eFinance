## 📌 Challenge

Since 2020, the Central Bank of Brazil has been working to establish a new form of intercommunication between banks, companies and customers; the platform named Open Finance Brasil. Traditionally, banks have always been huge vaults when it comes to storing their customers' data, and now there is a new paradigm that will generate infinite possibilities for integration and the creation of new products and services. As a way of analyzing the amounts charged for various services among Open Finance participants, we have the challenge of presenting, in an intuitive and fluid way, a price comparison tool using the data provided through Open Finance.

## 🏁 Project

**eFinance** is a web platform for monitoring fees for services and products offered by Brazilian financial institutions through open data made available by them and by the National Financial System.

At the end of development, the platform should have the following features:

* **Service Fee Panel**: view of service fees offered by a selected institution.

* **Ranking of Financial Institutions**: visualization of the classification of financial institutions according to the value of the selected service fee.

* **Top 5 Lowest Rates**: view of the ranking of the five institutions with the lowest rates for a selected service.

* **Fare Comparison**: visualization of the comparison of tariffs between the selected financial institutions.

* **History of Tariff Variation and Trend**: visualization of the selected tariff variation over a period and with a trend line.
